## üî¥ About Magtweaks
If you're here, it's because you're already familiar with my project, MagTweaks.
MagTweaks focuses on safely optimizing system performance without compromising Windows functionality. This is achieved through the intelligent disabling of unnecessary features, services, and processes.
This project has been rigorously tested on a wide range of systems, including Windows 10 and 11, both PCs and laptops, and hardware from brands like Intel, Ryzen, Nvidia, and Radeon.

## üü¢The benefits of this project include
- Improvements in overall system performance (FPS)
- Reduced latency (DPC/ISR)
- Network performance enhancements (bufferbloat)
