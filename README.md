Hello!
=
If you're here, it's because you know or have tried my work. I want to clarify that none of the files in this repository belong to me, except for "MagPlan.pow", "MagTweaks.nip", and "MagTweaks Shutup.cfg", which I have created myself. On the other hand, I have tested each of the application configurations on various systems, resulting in overall system performance improvements, reduced latencies (DPC), delta cycles below 0.03, and fewer FPS stutters on both NVIDIA and AMD, among other benefits.
#
Below, I detail the numerous systems on which I have tested these optimizations with excellent results:

- Ryzen 5 7800x & GTX 1650 & 16GB RAM 3200MT/S (XMP) DualChannel

- Ryzen 5 5600x & RX 6600 XT & 32GB RAM 3200MT/S (XMP) QuadChannel
